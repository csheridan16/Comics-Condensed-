    <div class="overview">
    
   <div class="bio"> 
       <p>Bruce Banner had a very tough upbringing, his father Dr. Brian Banner, an atomic scientist hated him with a passion due to an insane jealousy for Bruce’s mother loving him more than she did her husband. Brian Banner finally murdered Rebecca and was placed in a mental hospital. Bruce’s mind suffered great trauma resulting in dissociative identity disorder his personalities would later take on a life of their own as a big green monster.</p>
       
       <p>Bruce grew up to become an expert in nuclear physics working at a research facility in the middle of the desert in new Mexico. In his tenure at the United States Defense Department base Banner designed and oversaw construction of the "gamma bomb" or "G-bomb," a nuclear weapon that had a high gamma radiation output. During a test of this new bomb banner noticed a civilian had breached security and had entered the soon to be bomb site. </p>
       
       <p>Banner reached the teen named Rick Jones throwing him into a protective trench in the nick of time, but Banner wasn't so lucky. The Gamma bomb detonated and bombarded Banner with intense waves of radiation, Due to an unknown genetic factor in his body, Banner was not killed by the radiation, which instead caused him to transform frequently into the vastly powerful, green-skinned beast named "the Hulk" by the military present at the test site.</p>

    <h4>Why is this character loved so much?</h4>
    
    <p><b>Bruce Banner will never have a happy ending</b></p>
    
    <p>The sad reality of banner is that the hulk can never truly be happy, every time he goes outside he knows he is risking the life of the people around him. He is constantly reminded of the destruction the hulk has caused, reminded of the lives he’s ruined. This is why he mostly travels the roads, never settling in one place for long, because eventually the hulk will go rouge again. This makes the story of banner an undoubtable tragedy because even though he plays the hero he knows deep down the hulk will turn again its only a matter of time. This is the tragedy of his character he still feels the need to protect people despite how much they fear him and try to hurt him.</p>

    <p><i>“I've been "cured" before. And the Hulk always found a way back. I have to keep focus. Stay in control. Slow my breathing. Lower my heart rate. Push down these boiling emotions... because no matter what those machines say, I can still feel him, just under the skin... or can I?“</i></p>

     <p><b>Dissociative identity disorder</b></p>

<p>The character is essentially many different characters due to banner having dissociative identity disorder due to his traumatic childhood and each personality manifests as a hulk. Some of his different personalities are:</p>   
<p>Bruce Banner: A brilliant scientist whose superior knowledge of gamma radiation and the original personality</p>     
<p>Savage Hulk: A huge, angry, green man, who Bruce turns into whenever he gets mad. Not actually evil, but super strong, angry, and not very rational. Low intelligence. Embodies Bruce's anger and inner child.</p>     
<p>Joe Fixit: A huge grey man, who Bruce turns into at night. Super-strong, but not to the extent of Savage; intelligent and crafty, but lacks Bruce's genius. Enjoys life's baser pleasures - good food, fine clothes, and alcohol. Represents Bruce's antiheroic aspects.</p> 
<p>Professor Hulk:. A Hulk possessing Savage's strength, Joe's cunning, and Bruce's intelligence. Was apparently a fusion of the three, but turned out to be another alternate personality.Represents Bruce's idealised vision of himself.</p> 
<p>Devil Hulk: A reptilian Hulk that embodies Bruce's evil aspects. Regularly tries to break out, but is held in check by the other personalities. Wants to destroy the world.</p>      
    
    
    <p><b>Because Hulk is strongest one there is</b></p>
    <p>The interesting thing about the hulk is that the angrier he gets the more powerful he becomes and due to the tragic life of bruce banner the hulk has become incredibly powerful over the years, the most powerful form being that of world breaker hulk who’s every step shook the whole eastern seaboard and took on every hero in new york and won.</p>
