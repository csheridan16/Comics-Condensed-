    <div class="overview">
    
   <div class="bio"> 
       <p>Thor is the son of the goddess of earth Gaea and Odin, king of the Asgadian pantheon. He was trained by the gods to be a mighty warrior and one day even take his fathers mantle and lead asgard. In his youth he was tested and proved worthy of the mighty magical hammer Mjolnir made from the mystical metal Uru. During the 9th Century, Thor spent time on Earth, leading Vikings into battle. It was not until Thor's loyal Vikings attacked a Christian monastery that he turned his back on his followers, leaving Earth and spending centuries in Asgard.</p>
       
    
       <p>Then Thor's battle-hungry appetite led him to break a treaty between Asgard and the Frost Giants. Odin banished the young god of thunder to Earth without his memory, to teach Thor how to behave as a mere mortal. After a decade as a doctor, Donald Blake was drawn to Norway, and a subsequent encounter with a race of warmongering aliens named the Kronans. While hiding out in a cave, Blake found a mysterious wooden cane that turned out to be the enchanted hammer Mjolnir -- which transformed him back into the mighty Thor tHe God of thunder. Thor is forever torn between his divine home  the sacred halls of Asgard and the troubled lands of his adopted home, Earth.</p>

Self-Doubt
Even though Thor is a God he is not a hubris one his hammer Mjolnir needs the user to be worthy in order to lift it and even though thor is more than worthy enough to lift his weapon what makes him relatable is that he always doubts this worthiness. 

One of the coolest weapons in the universe
Thors weapon of choice is the magical hammer Mjolnir created at the behest of the All-Father Odin by the dwarven blacksmiths. To create the weapon, the three dwarves used a magical forge located in the heart of a star. The process was so intense that the star itself exploded, the Earth was nearly destroyed, and the dinosaurs were wiped out. Capable of annihilating worlds, Mjolnir can warp reality, control storms, let him to fly at light speed, teleport, control the earth, and unleash his strongest attack, the God Blast.
