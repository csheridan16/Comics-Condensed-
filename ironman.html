    <h4>Why is this character loved so much?</h4>
    
    <p><b>Has no actual superpowers</b></p>
      <p>Despite fighting alongside literal gods and super-soilders Stark has no actual powers, under the armour he is simply a man but that hasn't stopped him fighting hulks, celestials and many others with power beyond comprehension and still coming out on top.</p>

<p><i>â€œAnd I swear, as the man, Tony Stark-- As the Avenger fate chose to cast in the role of Iron Man-- That I will live to avenge those to avenge those whose lives have been lost through the ignorance of men like the man I once was. Or I will die trying!"</i></p>

     <p><b>His complex personality</b></p>
<p>Tony Stark has a massive personality and ego. On the surface he seems arrogant and sarcastic when in actuality he is one of the most caring and thoughtful heroes out there that is incredibly loyal and brave putting his life on the line to save the world a million times over.</p>

    <p><b>Conquered Alcoholism</b></p>
<p>Many heroes suffer from weakness and internal conflicts but none more than Tony Stark who has to deal with his weakness every second of everyday. While he has quit drinking stark for a long time would use the iron man armour when intoxicated and struggled for a long time with this addiction. But this is not an illness that simply goes away and the iron man comics never ignore this, it is an everyday internal uphill battle to stay on the wagon especially with the pressures he faces as a superhero.</p> 

<p><b>Founding member of the avengers</b>
<p>Together with Ant-Man, Wasp and Hulk, Iron Man helped form the Avengers to defend Earth against threats. He housed the Avengers in a mansion that was their base of operations for many many years and still funds the avengers team, its not cheap paying for all that spandex.</p>

<p><b>Genius level intellect</b>
<p>One thing that makes Stark so interesting is his intelligence, he invented his armour from a box of scraps in a cave and is constantly upgrading and tinkering with his inventions to prepare for any possible occasion. Tony Stark has foreseen the need for a Hulkbuster, Thorbuster, and all kinds of Marvel hero Busting Armors. He has even invented a sentient armor that has bonded with his skin.</p>
