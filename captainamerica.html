    <h4>Why is this character loved so much?</h4>
    
    <p><b>Unwavering morals</b></p>
      <p>Captain America has a set of morals like no other character in the marvel universe of courage, humility, righteous indignation, sacrifice and perseverance. And refuses to budge even if it means his own downfall as we see in the comic below refusing to stand with the illuminati when it was decided to save their planet they must destroy others resulting in cap having his mind wiped.</p>

<p><i>““Doesn't matter what the press says. Doesn't matter what the politicians or the mobs say. Doesn't matter if the whole country decides that something wrong is something right. This nation was founded on one principle above all else: The requirement that we stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds or the consequences. When the mob and the press and the whole world tell you to move, your job is to plant yourself like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world -- "No, YOU move.”"</i></p>

     <p><b>Always puts others before himself /Selflessness</b></p>
<p>Rogers will always put the safety of others before the safety of his own person at every possible opportunity. Hence why he carries his iconic shield to protect his team members or innocent civilians form immediate danger.</p>

    <p><b>He’s a man out of time.</b></p>
<p>One of the most interesting points about caps character is that he was frozen in the artic ice for years. He was awoken by the avengers after falling into the ice again trying to stop a bomb to save millions and had to readapt to modern life even though everyone he knew was long dead.</p> 

<p><b>Captain America embodies the American dream.</b>
<p>As the name suggests Steve Rogers represents what america is supposed to be, valuing freedom, liberty, and justice for all people. </p>
    <p><i>“I represent the American dream! A dream that has precious little to do with borders, boundaries, and the kind of blind hatred your ilk espouses!”</i></p>
    
    
    <p><b>Respected by everyone</b></p>
<p>Both heroes and villains alike respect and even fear captain america, the punisher refuses to fight him because of who he is.</p>
